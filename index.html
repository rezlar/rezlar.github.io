                  <p>I'm in my final year of high school at Thomas Haney Secondary in Maple Ridge, BC. After I graduate I plan (after upgrading some math) to apply for the Computer Systems
                  Technology progam at BCIT. I've been passionate about technology since the first time I touched a keyboard at 5 years old. In my spare time I like to make watchfaces for
                  the Pebble smartwatch. I've featured some of them below!</p>
                  <p>I am an Adobe Certified Associated in both Photoshop and InDesign CC, although I do most of my work in CS6. You can view my badges online at <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/user/turnervink">Acclaim</a>.</p>
