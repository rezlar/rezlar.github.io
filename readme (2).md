Spam-free contact form
=======================

This form will prevent the most common forms of automated "contact form spam" by adding a 
hidden field to the form. If any text is entered into the hidden field, the message is 
assumed to be spam and thrown out.

It also uses JavaScript to generate your email address as a clickable link after the page 
has loaded. This prevents scrapers that do not execute javascript from reading your email 
address.

It includes both a simple version and an advanced (pretty) version, you should only need 
to put one or the other on your website.
